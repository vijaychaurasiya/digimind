    <h2><strong>Antenna:</strong></h2>
      <p>Antennas are an indispensable part of any wireless communication system. 
        In any wireless communication system, after a radio frequency (rf) signal has been generated in a
        transmitter, some means must be used to radiate this signal through space to a receiver. The
        device that does this job is the antenna. The transmitter signal energy is sent into space by a
        transmitting antenna, the rf signal is then picked up from space by a receiving antenna.</p>
        <img class="img1" src="images/src1.jpeg" alt="antenna">
       <p> The rf energy is transmitted into space in the form of an electromagnetic field. As the travelling
        electromagnetic field arrives at the receiving antenna, a voltage is induced into the antenna
        (usually a conductor). The rf voltages induced into the receiving antenna are then passed into the
        receiver and converted back into the transmitted rf information.
        So, antennas can be thought of as a “transducer” that converts radio waves into electrical currents
        and voltages and vice versa. More specifically, these are devices designed to radiate or receive
        electromagnetic energy efficiently in a prescribed manner.</p>

    <h2><strong>Antenna Parameters:</strong></h2>
    <h3>Radiation pattern:</h3>
    <p> Radiation pattern is a graphical representation of the radiation properties of the antenna as a function of space coordinate
        The characteristics to note down from this pattern are:<br>
        (i) Main (major) lobe<br>
        (ii) Minor lobe (includes side lobes and back lobe)<br>
        (iii) Half-power beamwidth (HPBW)<br>
        (iv) Beamwidth between first nulls (BWFN)</p>
        <img class="img2" src="images/src2.jpeg" alt="lob">
        <p>A radiation pattern shows only the relative values but not the absolute values of the field or power
        quantity. Hence the values are usually normalized (i.e., divided) by the maximum value.
        The size of the minor lobes is much smaller than that of the major lobe. In order to clearly visualize the
        minor lobes, sometimes the scales of the radiation pattern are expressed in DB. By the reciprocity theorem, the radiation pattern of an antenna in the transmitting mode is same as
        those for the antenna in the receiving mode</p>
        <h3>Field Regions:</h3>
        <p>The space surrounding an antenna ia usually divided into two regions.<br>(1) Near field region<br>(2) Far field region</p>
         <p>Far field region is defined as that region of the field of an antenna where the angular field distribution <br>
        is independent of the distance from the antenna.</p>
        <p>This region is commonly taken to exist at distances greater than <strong>2D^2/lamda</strong> from the antenna.
        where D is overall dimention of antenna.This region is also called as thr Fraunhofer region.The field immediatly
    <br>surrounding the antenna and the far field region is known as near field region</p>
    <h3>Directivity:</h3>
    <img class="img3"  src="images/src3.jpeg" alt="Directivity">
    <p>This parameter indicates how well an antenna concentrates power into a limited solid angle.The directivity D of an<br>
    antenna is the ratio of the radiation intensity U direction (θ,φ) to the radiation intensity averaged over all direction U(0).<br>
 maximum directivity D(0) is the directivity in the maximum radiation direction (θ,φ)</p>
   <p><strong>D(0)= U(max)/U(0)= 4CU(max)/P(rad)</strong></p>
     <h3>Gain:</h3>
     <p>The gain or power gain of an antenna in a certain direction (θ,φ) is defined as <br>
         <strong>G(θ,φ)= radiation intensity/(total input power/4π = 4πU(θ,φ)/P(in)</strong></P>
         <img class="img4" src="images/src4.jpeg" alt= "gain"> <p> Where p(in) is the input power to the antenna 
        and is related to the radiated power P(rad) as <br><strong>P(in)Σ= P(rad) where Σ= Efficiency of antenna<br> The gain and directivity are related by<br>
            <strong>G(θ,φ)= ΣD(θ,φ)</strong><br> Maximum gain in terms of maximum directivity <br><strong>G(0)= 4πU(max)/P(in)= ΣD(0)</strong></p>
    
<h3>Impedence Bandwidth:</h3>
<P>It is defined as</P>
<img class="img5"  src="images/src5.jpeg" alt="bandwidth">
<h3>Polarization:</h3>
<p>Polarization or plane of polarization of wave can be defined by the direction in which the electric vector E is aligned during the passage of atleast one full cycle.
    Electric vector E and magnetic vector H are mutually perpendicular and this electromagnetic wave propogate in the perpendicular direction
    which mutually perpendicular directions of electric vector, magnetic vector and propagation.</p>

    <h2><strong>Dipole Antenna:</strong> </h2>
    <h3>Simple Dipole Antenna</h3>
    <img class="img7" src="images/src7.jpeg" alt="simple dipole">
    <p>A dipole antenna is the simplest type of radio antenna, consisting of a conductive wire rod that is half the length of the maximum wavelength the antenna is to generate. This wire rod is split in the middle, and the two sections are separated by an insulator.</p>
    <h3>Folded Dipole Antenna</h3>
    <img class="img8"  src="images/src8.jpeg" alt= "folded dipole">
    <p>The impedence of N folded dipole is N^2 times greater than that of an isolated dipole of the same lenght as one of its side.</p>
    <img class="img9" src="images/src9.jpeg" alt="folded dipole 2">
    <P>Impedence for 2 folded dipole antenna is </P>

    <h2><strong> Antenna Array </strong></h2>
    <p> The requirement for very directive antenna (for long
        distance communications) cannot be accomplished by the single element antennas as their
        radiation pattern is relatively wide. The directivity can be increased by increasing the dimensions of the
        radiating aperture compared to the wavelength (λ). This approach leads to mechanical problem and also
        difficult from fabrication point of view. Another way to increase the electrical size of an antenna is to
        arrange several antennas in space and interconnect to produce a directional radiation pattern. Such a
        configuration of multiple radiating elements to synthesize radiation characteristics, not available with a
        single antenna, is referred to as an array (antenna). Usually, the array elements are identical for simpler
        design and fabrication. Now-a-days, antenna arrays are becoming increasingly important in wireless
        communications.
        Advantages of using antenna array:
        1. In an array, provisions can be made to make the fields from individual elements interfere
        constructively in some directions and cancel in some other directions.
        2. They can provide the capability of a steerable beam (radiation direction change)
        3. They can provide a high gain (array gain) by using simple antenna elements
        4. They provide a diversity gain in multipath signal reception.
        There are several design variables that can be used to achieve the overall pattern of the array:
        a) The geometrical configuration of the overall array (linear, circular, spherical, rectangular, etc.)
        b) The relative placement of the elements
        c) The excitation amplitude of the individual elements
        d) The excitation phase of each element.
        e) The relative pattern of the individual elements </p>
       <h3>Broadside Arrays:</h3> 
       <p>An array is referred to as a broadside array when it has its maximum radiation in the direction
        perpendicular to that of axis of the array i.e. 90 degree  For optimum performance, both the element factor and the AF, should have their maxima at 90 degree.
        The maximum of the array factor occurs when the array phase function is zero.</p>
        <img class="img11"  src="images/src11.jpeg" alt="antenna array">
        <img class="img10" src="images/src10.jpeg" alt="array"> 
        <p>For a broadside array, in order for the above equation to be satisfied with 90 degree , the phase angle  must be zero i.e. all elements of the array must be driven with the same phase.</p>
